# Homework Week 3
This is my homework week 3.
It was iniatially submitted on Friday 2 December 2022 at 5.55am. However, due to issue with my visual studio, I couldnt save my work properly or perform commit and deloyment.
Now the issue has been fixed (at least that's how I believe it :) ). - I solved the issue myslef.
I put in the commment section link to my homework in github.
Hope that's okay.
Cheers
